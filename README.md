# Aviation Accidents Analysis

## Description

This project is divided into two main phases: data cleaning and transformation, and data analysis and visualization. It utilizes a dataset of aviation accidents to extract meaningful insights, explore trends, and generate useful visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is 'aviation-accident.csv'. It contains information on aviation accidents, like dates, fatalities, and other relevant details.

## Project Structure

- **data_cleaning.py**: Script for data cleaning and transformation.
- **data_analysis.py**: Script for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.


## Data Analysis and Visualization

We perform data analysis and generate visualizations to answer key questions:

1. ** Which country had the highest number of accidents?**
   - **Visualization**: Bar chart showing the number of accidents per country.
2. ** Which days of the week had the highest number of accidents?**
   - **Visualization**: Bar chart showing the number of accidents by day of the week.
3. ** What are the safest operators?**
   - **Visualization**: Table showing the top 5 operators with more than 5 accidents but no fatalities.
4. ** Which type of aircraft caused the most deaths?**
   - **Visualization**: Table listing the top 10 aircraft types with the highest number of fatalities.
5. ** How have aviation accidents evolved after September 11, 2001?**
   - **Visualization**: Line Plot comparing the number of accidents before and after September 11, 2001.
6. ** Average number of victims by accident category **
   - **Visualization**: Bar Char showig the average of fatalities per category of incident.
7. ** Trend of the average number of victims over the last 15 years. **
   - **Visualization**: Line Plot comparing average of fatalities with year.
8. ** Comparison of the averages of air accidents and the averages of victims
as a time reference of the last 10 years. **
   - **Visualization**: Line Plot comparing the average numbers with year.
9. ** How many times after a fatality-free accident is there an accident with at least one fatality? **
   - **Visualization**: Bar Char comparing incidets without fataities and incient with fatalities.
10. ** How are accidents distributed in countries present in the dataset? **
    - **Visualization**: Map comparing sum of fatalities between different countries.
